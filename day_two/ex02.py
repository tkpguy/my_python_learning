#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
#The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# ***************   BMI = weight(kg) / (height  X height)(sq.m)   ****************

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
print(int(weight / (height*height))) # or print(int(weight / (height**2)))
